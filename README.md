Purpose:
-----------
Identifying, extracting, and mobilizing information from current and historical literature is
a time-consuming part of organizing and collating synthetic data productions. This
project explores the use of algorithm-based methods to identify and extract relevant information
from literature databases to support upkeep of USGS databases.  These efforts are initially using 
two use cases, the Nonindigenous Aquatic Species (NAS) database and Dam Removal Information Portal (DRIP).

Development Status:
-------------------

efforts to help improve code and analyses are welcomed.
